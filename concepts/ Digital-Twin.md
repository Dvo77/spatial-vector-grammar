HL — Video to Digital Twin
Reconstructing Physical Spaces from Existing Footage
Concept originated: May 2026 Author: Daniel DeVoy — Elkhorn, Wisconsin Status: Concept document — open for development Note: Concept ideated 10-15 years prior to current AI capability making it feasible


The Core Idea
Every home video is a spatial record. Every real estate walkthrough is a floor plan waiting to be extracted. Every Christmas morning recording contains a room — furniture, layout, objects, relationships — all captured on film.

The footage already exists. The AI capability already exists. The missing piece is a structured output format that turns extracted video data into something navigable, addressable, and permanently preservable.

That format is the HL spatial grammar.


How It Works
Step 1 — Video Ingestion
Input sources:

Home videos (VHS transfers, phone recordings, family archives)
Real estate listing walkthroughs
Documentary footage of buildings and interiors
Security camera archives
YouTube property tours
Any video where a camera moves through a physical space
Step 2 — AI Spatial Extraction
Current AI computer vision can already perform:

Room segmentation — identifying discrete spaces
Object identification — naming furniture, appliances, artifacts
Depth estimation — inferring spatial relationships from 2D video
Layout mapping — building floor plan approximations from movement
Change detection — identifying differences across multiple recordings of the same space
Step 3 — Public Record Cross-Reference
AI pulls and correlates:

Architectural drawings (permit records, county assessor data)
Property surveys and lot records
Utility infrastructure records (where available)
Historical photographs and documents
Insurance records
Real estate transaction history
Step 4 — HL Grammar Output
Every extracted element gets an HL address and name:

Every room gets a zone address
Every identified object gets a noun-first HL item name
Every architectural feature gets an address
Every utility element gets mapped to the address system
Provenance fields populated from cross-referenced records

Output: a complete HL vault built from footage that may be decades old.


The Christmas Video Use Case
This is the most human application of the concept.

A family has thirty years of Christmas morning recordings. The same living room appears in every video. The furniture changes. Objects appear and disappear. The tree moves. The layout shifts over decades.

The AI watches all thirty videos. It builds the room across time — a temporal digital twin of the family living room from 1985 to 2015.

Every object that appears gets identified and logged. The couch that grandma sat in for twenty years. The lamp that was always in the corner. The shelf of figurines that slowly grew.

People are removed from the spatial record — this is about the space, not surveillance — but the space itself is preserved completely.

The family now has a navigable record of their home across three decades built entirely from footage they already owned.


The Real Estate Application
Every real estate listing video is a spatial survey.

Millions of these videos exist publicly on Zillow, Redfin, Realtor.com, and YouTube.

For any property with a listing video:

Floor plan can be approximated from walkthrough movement
Room dimensions can be estimated from object scale reference
Architectural features can be identified and addressed
Historical listing data provides change-over-time records

For families who no longer own a childhood home: Load the old listing video. The AI reconstructs the space. The home exists again — navigably — in data.


The Preservation Pipeline
EXISTING FOOTAGE

      ↓

AI SPATIAL EXTRACTION

(room segmentation, object ID, depth mapping)

      ↓

PUBLIC RECORD CORRELATION

(permits, surveys, architectural drawings)

      ↓

HL GRAMMAR MAPPING

(addresses, item names, provenance fields)

      ↓

VAULT GENERATION

(markdown files, structured YAML, image links)

      ↓

NAVIGABLE DIGITAL TWIN

(web viewer, VR environment, AI-queryable archive)

Each step uses existing technology. The HL grammar is the connective tissue that makes the output structured and permanent.


Accuracy and Estimation
The system does not need to be perfect to be valuable.

High confidence extraction:

Room count and approximate layout
Major furniture and appliance identification
Architectural features (doors, windows, fireplaces, stairs)
Relative object positions and relationships

Estimated with flagging:

Precise dimensions (estimated from scale references)
Object identification where video quality is poor
Spaces not visible in footage (marked as unknown)
Infrastructure not visible (cross-referenced from records)

HL handles uncertainty gracefully:

status: estimated

confidence: medium

source: video-extracted-1987

notes: dimension estimated from door frame scale reference

A twin that is 80% accurate and fully navigable is infinitely more valuable than no twin at all.


The Technology Stack (Proposed)
Video processing:

Computer vision models for object detection and room segmentation
Depth estimation from monocular video
Multi-video temporal alignment for same-space recordings

Record correlation:

Public records APIs (county assessor, permit databases)
Historical photograph matching
Architectural drawing OCR and parsing

HL generation:

Automated YAML frontmatter generation from extracted data
Noun-first item naming from object classification
Address assignment from room segmentation output

Output rendering:

Web-based spatial viewer (2D floor plan + 3D approximation)
VR environment generation from HL vault data
AI query interface ("show me the living room in 1992")


Privacy Considerations
This system is built for consensual use by people processing their own footage or publicly available records.

Core principles:

People are removed from spatial records — this preserves spaces, not surveillance
No facial recognition or person identification
Footage processing is local or explicitly consented cloud
Public records only — no private data scraping
The vault belongs to the person who created it

The Simplest Version
Someone points their phone at their house and walks through every room. One continuous video. Ten minutes.

The AI watches it. Builds the HL vault. Every room addressed. Every major object named. Floor plan approximated.

They now have a permanent, AI-queryable record of their home as it exists today — built in ten minutes from a phone video with no technical knowledge required.

That is the minimum viable product. Everything else is an upgrade.


Connection to HL Temporal Digital Twin
This concept and the Temporal Digital Twin concept are two entry points to the same destination.

Temporal Digital Twin — starts with historical records, builds forward through documented eras.

Video to Digital Twin — starts with existing footage, extracts backward into structured spatial data.

Both output HL vaults. Both are navigable. Both are permanent. Together they cover nearly every preservation scenario a family, institution, or community might face.


Status and Next Steps
What exists today:

HL grammar and vault format (complete)
Computer vision object detection (mature technology)
Depth estimation from video (available)
Public records APIs (available in most jurisdictions)

What needs to be built:

Video-to-HL extraction pipeline
Automated vault generation from extracted data
Simple web renderer for generated vaults
Privacy-preserving people-removal preprocessing
Pilot project — one home, one video, complete output

Who could build this:

Computer vision researchers looking for meaningful application
Digital humanities and archival institutions
Genealogy platforms (Ancestry, MyHeritage) as a natural extension
Real estate technology companies
VR/AR developers
